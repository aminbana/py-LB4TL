# Python Implementation of Vectorized (Feed-Forward Neural Network) Lower-Bound for Temporal Logic (LB4TL) 

This repository provides the Python implementation of the [LB4TL](https://github.com/Navidhashemicodes/LB4TL) package, originally developed in MATLAB. Our implementation fully supports vectorized computation by converting signal temporal logic formulas into a PyTorch neural network, leveraging GPU acceleration for enhanced performance.
